# Neural Network Implementation in Numpy
* As opposed to a standard PyTorch or Tensorflow model, the goal of this project was to code a neural net from "scratch" in numpy <br /> 
* The model was trained and evaluated on the mnist dataset, an image database of handwritten digits. The dataset can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) <br />
* Results from a simple PyTorch model are also included and can be found in mnist_classifier_torch.ipynb
